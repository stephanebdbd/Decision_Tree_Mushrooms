# Decision Tree Implementation (Mushroom Classification)

Welcome to the **Decision Tree Implementation** repository! This project implements a series of algorithms in Python, providing an ideal foundation for learning and experimentation.

## 🚀 Project Goal

**Decision Tree Implementation** aims to provide:

* Clear implementations of various algorithms.
* An educational platform to explore, learn, and refine your algorithmic skills.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

* **`src/`**: Contains the source code for the algorithm implementations.
* **`tests/`**: Contains unit tests to ensure the reliability of the algorithms.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following environment set up:

* **Python** (version >= 3.7)
* Install the necessary libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
